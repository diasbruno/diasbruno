I'm a Senior Software Engineer currently working with Common Lisp, Haskell, 
Elm and Javascript/Typescript. But also Ruby and Python. 
F#, C/C++, Rust and Go are in my list of interests.

Currently, I'm working on meta programming systems to leverage the power 
of run-time and compile-time code generation targeting many languages 
using common lisp.

On my free time, I'm a skateboarder, tennis player and musician.
